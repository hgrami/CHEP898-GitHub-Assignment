# Introduction to Git and GitHub Assignment

This repository contains my work for the **Introduction to Git and GitHub** assignment. The goal is to practice using Git for version control and GitHub for sharing work, including creating a repository, committing and pushing changes, and submitting a pull request (PR) with a gif to the class repository.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, I practiced:

- Setting up and personalizing a GitHub account
- Installing Git and configuring it locally (name + email)
- Creating a public GitHub repository
- Cloning a repository into an RStudio project
- Creating and editing a `README.md`
- Committing and pushing work to GitHub
- Cloning the class assignment repo and submitting a PR with a gif

## Repository Contents

- `README.md` (this file)

## How I Set This Up (High-Level)

### 1) GitHub Account
- I already had an github account setup

### 2) Git Installation + Configuration (R / RStudio)
Configured Git in RStudio, this can be done with `usethis`:

### 3) Repository Creation
- Created a new **public** GitHub repository named: `CHEP898-GitHub-Assignment`

### 4) Clone to Local (RStudio Project)
- Cloned this repo locally and opened it as an RStudio project
- Added this `README.md`

### 5) Commit + Push Workflow
For the main work (including my data wrangling assignment):

1. Make changes locally
2. Stage changes
3. Commit with a meaningful message
4. Push to GitHub
5. Verify changes appear on GitHub


## Pull Request With a Gif (Class Repo)

I also cloned the **class GitHub assignment repository**, added a gif representing my experience with this assignment, and submitted a **pull request**.

## Experience Notes (What I Learned / What Hurt)

A few things that stood out while doing this:

- The Git workflow is straightforward once you stop trying to do everything out of order.
- Commit messages matter more than people think. Future-me will thank present-me.
- The mental model that helped most:  
  **Working directory → Staging area → Commit history → Remote (GitHub)**
